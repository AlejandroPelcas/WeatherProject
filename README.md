# WeatherProject

In this project we are using Weather.gov's API to extract the forcast for cities in the bay area.

## Front-end
We use HTML/CSS/JS to create the webpage where users can interact with the weather API to update weather.

## Back-end
We use a python script to gather and store OpenWeather's data through their API and run a server using Flask so that clients can update the webpage's weather data. 

## Flask packages
pip3 install flask flask_login flask_bcrypt flask_wtf wtforms email_validator
