/* Special Data types:
    underfined -  
    symbol - 
    null - specifically set to null
        var a; // this is currently null

* const vs var vs let :
    const - value should not be changing
    let   - only used within the scope it was creeated
    var   - persistent thoughtout all program

* Increment variable (nums)
    var num = 9;
    num++; // this increments num by 1
    num--; // this decrements num by 1
    Can also do nums += 1 or nums -= 1

* Quoting strings with ""
    use single quotes with big str then double for in 
    `<a href="http://google.com">`
    \n - new line 
    \r - carriage return
    \t - tab
    \b - backspace
    \f - form feed
    \\ - tab

* String length
    var a = "hello"
    a.length >> 5

* Arrays can hold different datatypes
    var ourArray = ["ale", 2]
  Push()

* api_tokens : important to limit the amount of calls to make even if its free


* await


* fetch("someApi.com")
    returns a response object. 
    Takes a request object and needs to know method: (POST,GET)
    If you don't specify it'll assume GET
    * It's ASYNCHRONOUS - so returns a PROMISE rather than the response
